# JavaFundamentals

This repo is a series of Java exercises to let a student gain confidence in the very basics of Java.

This gives you everything you need to understand and practice the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in Java. 
The content is designed to build confidence while introducing essential object-oriented programming concepts in an accessible way.

In each of these topic folders, you will find a topic.jsh file that you will edit with your solutions to the exercises.
Then, you will run the topic.jsh file using `jshell` command. 
Get all the tests passing, and move on to another topic in the list.
